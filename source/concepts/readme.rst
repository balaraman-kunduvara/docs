OPAL is an Automation Framework for process and application automation.
Guess what? It is an open source framework and free to use.
Yippe! Now there is nothing stopping you from implementing all those
creative process improvements projects you had in your mind.

OPAL is based on the `Node-RED <https://nodered.org/>`_ project by IBM. Node-RED was primarily for Internet of Things.
